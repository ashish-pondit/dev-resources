Key Concepts of Java I/O Streams:
Stream: A stream is a sequence of data. In Java, streams are used to represent data transfer, either for input (reading) or output (writing).

Types of Streams:

Input Streams: Used for reading data.
Output Streams: Used for writing data.
Byte Streams vs. Character Streams:

Byte Streams: Handle raw binary data (e.g., images, files). Classes for byte streams include:
InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream)
OutputStream (e.g., FileOutputStream)
Character Streams: Handle text data (e.g., .txt files). Classes for character streams include:
Reader (e.g., FileReader)
Writer (e.g., FileWriter)
Basic Classes in java.io:

InputStream: Abstract superclass for all byte input streams. Examples:
FileInputStream: Reads bytes from a file.
BufferedInputStream: Buffers input for efficient reading.
OutputStream: Abstract superclass for all byte output streams. Examples:
FileOutputStream: Writes bytes to a file.
BufferedOutputStream: Buffers output for efficient writing.
Reader: Abstract superclass for all character input streams. Examples:
FileReader: Reads characters from a file.
BufferedReader: Buffers input for efficient character reading.
Writer: Abstract superclass for all character output streams. Examples:
FileWriter: Writes characters to a file.
BufferedWriter: Buffers output for efficient character writing.
