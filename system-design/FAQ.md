### [Web server vs. Application server](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-web-server-and-application-server/#:~:text=A%20web%20server%20is%20a,compute%20the%20web%20server's%20response.)
Web servers and application servers are the technologies that allow the exchange of data and services over the internet. The client-server architecture is the underlying mechanism of the internet. When you visit a website or application, your browser (as the client) requests data from a remote server and displays the response. A **web server** is a software component that delivers **static data** like images, files, and text in response to client requests. An **application server** adds **business logic** to compute the web server's response. Both terms are used synonymously, and the most popular server software solutions today are hybrid web application servers.
